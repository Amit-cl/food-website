      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Amit Kumar, a 6th semester B.Tech student following the AKTU syllabus. 
        I am passionate about software development, problem-solving, and building 
        real-world applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work on full-stack projects, especially using React for the frontend 
        and Spring Boot for the backend. My current major project is an 
        AI-based Route Optimization System, and I’ve also built a 
        Student Information System for my Software Engineering lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        I actively practice Data Structures & Algorithms on platforms like LeetCode, 
        focusing on recursion, dynamic programming, graphs, trees, and linked lists. 
        I’m also preparing for campus recruitment aptitude tests.
      </p>
